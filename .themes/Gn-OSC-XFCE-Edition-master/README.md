This is a XFCE-cation of my well received Gnome OSC-theme, a gnome-desktop-interpretation of a certain Cupertino-based OS.
Carefully crafted to blend seamlessly GTK2- and GTK3-applications. This theme is solid, tested and up-to-date for Gnome 3.26, to use as daily desktop-theme, adjusted to make it work on the XFCE-desktop.

This theme is build upon- and made to work for Xubuntu 17.10. This requires at least GTK 3.20+
Other XFCE-distro's might have problems.

The standard XFWM-windowmanager is used as the compositor, With the following specific settings in the Window Manager Tweaks:
- display compositing enabled.
- Synchronize drawing to the vertical blank enabled.
- Show shadows under dock windows enabled.
Opacity of popup windows is set more to the left (more transparency): this gives the translucency under the drop down-menu's. You can move the layer more to the left for more transparency.

### To install:

Download the file and extract. Move the extracted file to your '.themes'-folder in your home-folder (you might have to make the folder first, if you haven't done it already.)
Open up the Appearance-app and select the style 'Gn-OSC-XFCE-Edition'
To make the titlebar: open up the Window Manager and select again 'Gn-OSC-XFCE-Edition'.

To move the buttons to the left ( in Window Manager ) click and drag the button layout so that you have CLOSE/MINIMIZE/MAXIMIZE and TITLE (in that order).

You will notice that Whisker Menu is themed also.
